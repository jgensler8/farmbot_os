## _*Important*_
For now we are only building and supporting Raspberry Pi 3. Pull Requests are very welcome
if you spot a bug or fix, but for now we suggest obtaining a Raspberry Pi 3 for the best support.

# Farmbot OS
The "brains" of the FarmBot Project

## Installation
Installation should be fairly straight forward, you will need a computer for this step.
(everything after this can be set up on a mobile device.)

### Windows users

 1. download and install [Etcher](https://etcher.io/).
 0. download the [latest release](#floppy_disk-latest-os-image-downloads).
 0. insert an SD Card into your PC.
 0. open Etcher, and select the `.img` file you just downloaded.
 0. select your SD Card.
 0. Burn.

### Linux/OSX

 1. download the [latest release](#floppy_disk-latest-os-image-downloads).
 0. ```dd if=</path/to/file> of=/dev/<sddevice> bs=4``` or use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/).

## Running
 1. Plug your SD Card into your Raspberry Pi
 0. Plug your Arduino into your Raspberry Pi
 0. Plug your power into your Raspberry Pi
 0. From a WiFi enabled device*, search for the SSID `farmbot-XXXX`
 0. Connect to that and open a web browser to [http://192.168.25.1/](http://192.168.25.1)
 0. Follow the on screen instructions to configure your FarmBot. Once you save your configuration FarmBot will connect to your home WiFi network and to the FarmBot web application.
